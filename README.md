How to create a github page\
- go into the settings of the repository you wish to create a website of\
- Scroll through the different sidebars until you find the Pages tab\
- Find the Build and Deployment section, then select your desired branch for the website and save.\
- Refresh the page continuously until a notice pops up that the site is live\
- Create your own index.html and css files to develop your site\
Although not my strong suit, I was able to somewhat familiarize myself more with both HTML and CSS through this exercise, and was able to learn a new function of GitHub, GitHub Pages.\
